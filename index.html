            <h2>Hi, my name is Minh. I'm from Boston, MA and welcome to my portfolio page.</h2> 
            <hr>
            <p>I want to inspire you to bring your vision into reality. We all have ideas sitting in the recesses of our minds screaming to come out. Is it an online, small business you dream of starting? Are you a musician or an artist searching for a creative homebase? Or maybe you're a psycho trying to spread a political ideology only you can come up with. Whatever your desire, I am here to collaborate with you and to drive your vision forward.</p> 
            <p>As a reasonably likely Thinkful graduate, I am well-versed in both front-end and back-end development. My career of choice and creative outlet is web development. Please refer to my <a href="#">Portfolio Page</a> for samples of my work. My passion in writing and design will help your website stand out among the sea of mediocre web design. </p>
            <p>Let's not waste precious time and push your ideas forward together before it's too late. The world seems like it will end at any moment. Let's get started today.</p>
